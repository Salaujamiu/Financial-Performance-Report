# 🧾 Monthly Financial Performance Analysis using Python

This project demonstrates how to analyze, visualize, and report on monthly departmental financial data using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. It blends accounting knowledge with data analytics to generate actionable business insights from raw financial data.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset covers a full year of monthly revenue and expense data across 5 departments:
- Sales
- Operations
- Admin
- Finance
- IT

From this data, we calculate profit and profit margin, perform monthly trend analysis, and identify department-level performance patterns.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Revenue was lowest in July and recovered toward Q4.
- Profit margins were volatile, with losses recorded in July.
- Operations and Sales departments drove the most profit.
- Admin, Finance, and IT consistently operated at a loss, suggesting high overhead costs.
